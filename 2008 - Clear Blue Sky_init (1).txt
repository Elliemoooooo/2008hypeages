If he fails to accomplish that, he'll be remembered as the calm before the storm.</p>",

One of the things that best characterizes his victory is not that he was the most wanted candidate, but that he was the least like Dubya, a distinction that has turned out to be less charming in practice than in theory. The entirety of Graham's political identification with the character of being the sensible choice, the safe leader, the one who checks the facts while everybody else improvises, is thrown into question.</p>\n\n\n\nBut the four-year term in the Oval Office has exposed the emptiness of his political ideals and the divide between his know-how and his lack of purpose, except for the vague idea that someone must do it. Every morning, he lives the experience of being an impostor, with a White House that he got by mistake and full of notebooks with very detailed comments about a government that he never really wanted, and he is still trying to figure out how to make it work.</p>\n\n\n\nHe needs to convince himself that the qualities and not the charisma are what count, that the substance will triumph over the style, and that the Americans will eventually be grateful for having a president who sees the office as a very important middle management position. He is not allowed to be just a brief interlude between the disasters of the Republican Party, albeit that is exactly what he has become.</p></div>",
